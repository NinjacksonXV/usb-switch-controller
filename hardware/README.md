## Schematic (WIP)
<img src=./schematics/usb-switch-controller.svg style="background: white;">
The above schematic is WIP; it is missing a 10KΩ pull-down resistor leading from base to the shared GND. This will be updated in the future once I've learned KiCad.

## Bill of Materials
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- 2x USB 2.0 female ports
- 1x 1KΩ, 1x 10KΩ resistors
- BC547B NPN Transistor
- USB-C port
- 1x protoboard/perfboard (unknown size, for now)
